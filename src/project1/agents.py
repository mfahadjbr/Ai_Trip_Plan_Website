"""
Creating Agents Cheat Sheet:
- Think like a boss. Work backwards from the goal and think which employee 
    you need to hire to get the job done.
- Define the Captain of the crew who orient the other agents towards the goal. 
- Define which experts the captain needs to communicate with and delegate tasks to.
    Build a top down structure of the crew.

Goal:
 - Create a 7-day Trip with detailed per-day plans,
 including budget, packing suggestions, and safety tips.
 

Captain/Manager/Boss:
-Expert Travel Agent


Employees/Experts to hire:
-City Selection Expert
-Local Travel Agent 

Notes:
- Agents should be results driven and have a clear goal in mind
- Role is their job title
- Goals should actionable
- Backstory should be their resume
